Spinach is only slightly higher than broccoli because let's face it, you can barely tell it's there. It's still a weird vegetable to top a pizza with, but at least it can kind of blend in with the other flavors. Still, if someone is asking for spinach on their pizza, you have to wonder why. After all, even more so than the green olive argument, spinach really does end up adding no flavor to the finished product. It's extraneous.

When that happens, a fridge filled with homemade sauces offers the promise of a nearly effortless meal.\n\nThe quickest way to dishes that thrill with big flavour is to dollop, spread or drizzle any of the options that follow on main ingredients that require minimal to no prep: Pull out leftovers; buy a rotisserie chicken; slice a block of tofu; cook eggs or noodles or both; season vegetables, seafood or meat with only oil and salt, then grill, roast or sear. And yes, you can also just grab a bag of chips and start dipping. This collection of sauces, with contributions from Melissa Clark, Eric Kim, Genevieve Ko and Yewande Komolafe, has a recipe for just about every occasion.",

        "shortDescription": "breakfast cereal, grain food, usually precooked or ready-to-eat, that is customarily eaten with milk or cream for breakfast in the United States and elsewhere, often sweetened with sugar, syrup, or fruit. The modern commercial concept of cereal food originated in the vegetarian beliefs of the American Seventh-day Adventists, who in the 1860s formed the Western Health Reform Institute, later renamed the Battle Creek Sanitarium, in Battle Creek, Michigan. The entrepreneurial possibilities of the ground, thin-baked cereal dough served to the sanitarium’s patients",
        "description": "Ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are of four basic types: flaked, made from corn, wheat, or rice that has been broken down into grits, cooked with flavours and syrups, and then pressed into flakes between cooled rollers; puffed, made by exploding cooked wheat or rice from a pressure chamber, thus expanding the grain to several times its original size; shredded, made from pressure-cooked wheat that is squeezed into strands by heavy rollers, then cut into biscuits and dried; and granular, made by a process in which a stiff dough made from wheat and malted barley flour, salt, yeast, and water is fermented, is baked thoroughly, and then, after being crumbled and rebaked, is ground into rough grains. As a final step in each process, the cereal is treated to restore vitamins lost through cooking and is often coated with sweet flavouring.\n\nBoiled crawfish is a popular Cajun dish.\nBRITANNICA QUIZ\nFoods Around the World: Fact or Fiction?\nFood can be more than just tasty.
